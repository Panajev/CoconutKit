/**
 * Usually, when you have to display some value on screen, and if you are using Interface Builder to design your
 * interface, you have to create and bind an outlet. Though this process is completely straightforward, this 
 * tends to clutter you code and becomes increasingly boring, especially when the number of values to display
 * is large.
 *
 * CoconutKit view bindings allow you to bind values to views directly in Interface Builder, via user-defined
 * runtime attributes instead of outlets. Two attributes are available:
 *   - bindKeyPath: The keypath to which the view will be bound. This can be any kind of keypath, even one
 *                  containing keypath operators
 *   - bindFormatter: Values to be displayed must be strings. If bindKeyPath returns another kind of object,
 *                    you must provide the name of a formatter method with prototype
 *                       - (NSString *)methodName:(<Class>)object
 *                    turning it into a string. In this case, bindFormatter must be set to 'methodName:' (how
 *                    method lookup is performed is explained below). Alternatively, you can provide a
 *                    global class formatter method '+[<Class> methodName:]'
 *
 * With no additional measure, keypath lookup is performed along the responder chain, starting with the view
 * bindKeyPath has been set on, and stopping at the first encountered view controller (if any is found). View
 * controllers namely define a local context, and it does not make sense to proceed further along the responder
 * chain. The same is true for formatter selector lookup.
 *
 * Often, though, values to be bound stem from a model object, not from the responder chain. In this case,
 * call -bindToObject:, passing it the object bindings must be made against. In this case, the keypath must
 * be valid for this object. Formatter lookup is first made on the object class itself, then along the responder
 * chain (again stopping at view controller boundaries). Global formatters can of course still be used as well.
 *
 * The binding information is resolved once when views are unarchived, and stored for efficient later use. Values
 * are not updated automatically. You can call -bindToObject: to set a new object, or if you want to update
 * the bound views with the most recent values available, simply call -refreshBindings.
 *
 * It would be painful to call -bindToObject: or -refreshBindings: on all views belonging to a view hierarchy.
 * For this reason, such calls are made recursively for you. Simply call the methods at the top of the view
 * controller hierarchy (or even on the view controller itself, see UIViewController+HLSViewBinding) to bind
 * all subviews. Note that each view class decides whether it recursively binds its subviews or not (see
 * HLSViewBinding protocol)
 *
 * In most common cases, you want to bind a single view hierarchy to a single object. You can of course have
 * separate view hierarchies within the same view controller context, each one bound to a different object.
 * Nesting can be more subtle and depends on the order in which -bindToObject: is called. Though you should
 * in general avoid such designs, you can still bind objects by calling -bindToObject: from the topmost parent
 * view to the bottommost child view.
 *
 * TODO: Document validation and sync in the other direction (when available)
 * TODO: Formatter resolving: Instance method first, then class method (along responder chain, then on object)
 *
 * Bindings have been implemented for the following UIView subclasses:
 *   - UILabel
 * You can implement bindings for other classes by having them implement the HLSViewBinding protocol.
